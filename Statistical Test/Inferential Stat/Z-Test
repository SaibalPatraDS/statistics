Question 1 : The average or mean is 3.1 hours and the standard deviation is 0.5. Find the percentage of less than 3.5 hours.

Hint -

z = (x - x')/o
where, x = sample points x' = sample mean o = sample variation

## importing necessary libraries
​
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
from scipy import stats
## calculating z score
​
mean_ = 3.1 
stddev_ = 0.5 
​
z_score = (3.5 - mean_)/stddev_
​
z_score
0.7999999999999998
## calculating area
​
stats.norm.cdf(z_score)  # norm - normal distribution
                         # cdf - cumulative distribution function
0.7881446014166033
Conclusion -
78.81% percentage of area is under 3.5 hours.

​
Question 2 : The average or mean is 28 lb and the standard deviation is 2 lb. Find the percentage btw 27 lb and 31 lb.

Hint -

calculate z1 for 27 lb and z2 at the value of 31 lb. And the area between them will be the answer.

mean_ = 28 
stddev_ = 2 
​
sample1 = 27 
sample2 = 31
z_score1 = (sample1 - mean_)/stddev_
z_score2 = (sample2 - mean_)/stddev_
z_score1, z_score2
(-0.5, 1.5)
## calculating underline area
​
area_percent = stats.norm.cdf(z_score2) - stats.norm.cdf(z_score1)
area_percent
0.624655260005155
Conclusion -
62.47% percentage of area is between 27 lb and 31 lb.

​
Question 3 : In top 10%, the mean is 200 and the standard deviation is 20. Find the lowest possible score to qualify.

Hint -

Our confidence interval is given and that is 10% or 0.10. And the mean of the sample is 200 and standard deviation is 20.

So, sample_point, x = z_score * standard_deviation + mean and this sample_point will be minimum value/ min score to qualify.

mean_ = 200 
stddev_ = 20 
​
z_score_ = stats.norm.ppf(0.90) # ppf - probability point function
​
'''The Probability Point Function or PPF is the inverse of the CDF. 
Specifically, the PPF returns the exact point where the probability of everything to the left is equal to y .'''
z_score_
1.2815515655446004
## calculating the terminal point
​
sample_point = z_score_ * stddev_ + mean_
sample_point
225.631031310892
Conclusion -
Lowest possible score is 226 or the student has to score 226 to be in top 10%

​
Question 4 : To select the middle 60% of the population, the mean is 120 and the standard deviation is 8. Find the upper and lower values.

Hint -

Simple calculation, we have to select the middle 60% means there will be 20% to the left and 20% to the right of the selected region. We have find z_score for 20% or 0.20 confidence and z_score for 80% or 0.80 confidence intervel.

z_score_20 = stats.norm.ppf(0.20) // z_score for ist 20%

z_score_80 = stats.norm.ppf(0.80) // z_score for 80%

And next formula we will be using, sample_point = z_score * standard_deviation + mean

mean_ = 120
stddev_ = 8
​
z_score_20 = stats.norm.ppf(0.20)
z_score_80 = stats.norm.ppf(0.80)
​
z_score_20, z_score_80
(-0.8416212335729142, 0.8416212335729143)
## calculating lower and upper value of the range
​
lower_val = (z_score_20 * stddev_) + mean_
upper_val = (z_score_80 * stddev_) + mean_
​
lower_val, upper_val
(113.26703013141669, 126.73296986858331)
print("Range of values for selecting 60% only", lower_val, "< X <", upper_val)
Range of values for selecting 60% only 113.26703013141669 < X < 126.73296986858331
Conclusion -
To select the middle 60%, lower limit will be 113.267 and upper limit will be 126.7329

**(113.26703013141669 < X < 126.73296986858331)
